# Tantra-Lekh | Blogging Website

The above project is a simple blogging website created using the Streamlit framework in Python. It allows the user to create new blog posts, including a title, tags, content, and optional image. The user can also choose between Markdown and plain text formatting for their blog post.

In the main content area, the website displays all existing blog posts, including their title, tags, date/time, and content. If a post has an associated image, it is also displayed. The website automatically sorts the posts in reverse chronological order based on their timestamp.

The project demonstrates how to create a basic web application using Streamlit, and how to interact with the file system to read and write data to and from the application. It also shows how to add basic formatting options and upload image files using the Streamlit framework.
